# JustCost.Us
I created this website for the A100 program, New Haven/Winter Cohort 2015. 
It allows people to enter prices paid (or discovered) for common goods & services, 
then lets other folks scan the database using any search word for what others have paid for same item.
Features 16 preset categories of products/services, and it uses a Google Geolocation API for
(1) search results filtering
(2) local advertising

The site was built with the Meteor javascript framework which enables rapid front & backend website creation
